# i have added some basic things just quickly ill keep working on it later just have a look at basic things
# u can add whatever you want # also its easier just to run the code in your own app like vscode 
 # so just copy and paste things in and out

#my plan is to make a math website and code a math calculator into it and hopefully i could use it for my IA (paper 3 ) of computer science
